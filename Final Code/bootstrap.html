		      	<p>
					After a scenic drive from Christchurch, we arrived at the White Horse Hill campsite, located at the base of Mount Cook. We set up our tents and enjoyed a relaxing picnic lunch while taking in the stunning views of the mountains and glaciers. In the afternoon, we went on a short hike to the nearby Hooker Valley Track, which offered breathtaking views of the Hooker Glacier and the surrounding mountains. As the sun started to set, we returned to our campsite and made a delicious dinner over a campfire.

		    	<h4>Day 2 : </h4>
		      	<p>
					We woke up early to catch the sunrise over Mount Cook, which was a truly unforgettable experience. After breakfast, we embarked on a challenging hike up to the Mueller Hut, a rustic mountain hut located on a ridge with panoramic views of the alpine landscape. The hike was steep and demanding, but the views from the top were worth it. We spent the afternoon exploringthe surrounding area and taking in the beauty of the park, which included glaciers, alpine lakes, and wildflowers. In the evening, we returned to our campsite and enjoyed a hearty meal while sharing stories and photos from our day.

					On our final day in Mount Cook National Park, we decided to take it easy and explore the nearby village of Tekapo.

We also went on a relaxing walk along the lake and enjoyed a delicious lunch at a local restaurant.
